# 🌟 Professional Open Source & GitHub Customization Services

Open source powers ERP systems, CRMs, dashboards, DevOps pipelines, CMS platforms, and SaaS frameworks. But generic builds rarely fit every business.  

We transform **GitHub repositories and open-source applications** into tailored, production-ready solutions. You get the **flexibility of open source** with the **precision of custom development**.  

We work across all major operating systems — **Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, Alpine, Arch, SUSE, Red Hat, Windows (including WSL), and macOS** — ensuring your customized open-source project runs reliably on your target environment. We also support **cloud platforms** like AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, and containerized deployments with Docker and Kubernetes.

- **Branch & Workflow Optimization** → Configure protected branches, PR workflows, and review pipelines.  
- **GitHub Actions & CI/CD** → Automate builds, testing, and deployments with custom workflows.  
- **License & Compliance Guidance** → Ensure your use of open source respects licenses safely.  
- **Upstream Contributions** → Where possible, align changes with the community for long-term support.  

👉 Example: Forked a GitHub ERP repo to build a **custom logistics module** and integrated GitHub Actions for automated AWS deployments.  
👉 Example: Customized a GitHub SaaS boilerplate with **multi-tenant billing** and **SSO login**, then rebranded it for enterprise clients.
