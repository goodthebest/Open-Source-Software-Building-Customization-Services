## 🔗 GitHub & Open Source Application Expertise

Most open-source software today lives on **GitHub**.  
We specialize in taking **GitHub repositories**—whether community-driven or private—and customizing them to fit your business needs.

- **Repo Customization** → Fork, modify, and extend GitHub projects (apps, frameworks, APIs).  
- **Branch & Workflow Optimization** → Configure protected branches, PR workflows, and review pipelines.  
- **GitHub Actions & CI/CD** → Automate builds, testing, and deployments with custom workflows.  
- **License & Compliance Guidance** → Ensure your use of open source respects licenses safely.  
- **Upstream Contributions** → Where possible, align changes with the community for long-term support.  

👉 Example: Forked a GitHub ERP repo to build a **custom logistics module** and integrated GitHub Actions for automated AWS deployments.  
👉 Example: Customized a GitHub SaaS boilerplate with **multi-tenant billing** and **SSO login**, then rebranded it for enterprise clients.
